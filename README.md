# CALCLI

### This cli tool lets you create operations and separate them into sections.

It functionality is to help you get all the calculations you want, with sections separations.
Returns you back the sum of all sections and the total for each section aswell.

-- Section separation = ","

-- Supported operations = "-, +, \*, /"

### How to run

    make run-api
    make run-gui | make run-cli (Whatever you prefer)

--- Take into account that to run the FE you have to create a .env file inside app/services/frontend with your android IP address/

- Feel free to sugest any chances or to create a PR in case you want to add something.
- Mainly did this to learn a little bit more about go.

Updates will be probably present in the future but I'm not sure what that would imply.
